# RecWalkerCounter
Personal Repo for developing the Database API for this class project

I'm doing this because I accidently deleted my old Database API

# How to Use
The important file is the DBInterface file but all of the files except for the test.php file are required. Run the test.php file to see 
the output of the DBInterface.php file.

# Needed Work
Once verified, I will go in and delete all of the print statements from the functions since they won't be needed when the API is being 
used.
