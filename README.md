# Purpose - Walking Traffic Counter
The Rec Center opened a new South Entrance not too long ago. The project costed millions 
with all of the research, simulation and construction that went into the design. But anecdotally, 
the usage has not been as had hoped. The University doesnâ€™t want to spend more money to 
determine if indeed the new entrance is being under - utilized, so, they have asked for a cross 
university collaboration on developing instruments that can count one - way
foot traffic that can be used anywhere inside on campus. With the arrival of Prof. Lupoli, 
(and his big mouth), it was determined that this project could be managed with the material 
you will learn inside and outside of this class. The overall design will use an Arduino 
interface to measure the traffic, and send data to a web accessible page and 
database for further research. Your group is not the only people that will work on this. Your 
work will be passed to another group. It is essential that you remember this, and build your 
work knowing someone will be finishing it. Since it will be passed on, there will be a coding 
standards that must be adhered to.
