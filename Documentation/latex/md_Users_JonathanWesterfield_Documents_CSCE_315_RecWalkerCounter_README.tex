Personal Repo for developing the Database A\+PI for this class project

I\textquotesingle{}m doing this because I accidently deleted my old Database A\+PI

\section*{How to Use}

The important file is the \doxyref{D\+B\+Interface}{p.}{interface_d_b_interface} file but all of the files except for the \doxyref{test.\+php}{p.}{test_8php} file are required. Run the \doxyref{test.\+php}{p.}{test_8php} file to see the output of the \doxyref{D\+B\+Interface.\+php}{p.}{_d_b_interface_8php} file.

\section*{Needed Work}

Once verified, I will go in and delete all of the print statements from the functions since they won\textquotesingle{}t be needed when the A\+PI is being used.
