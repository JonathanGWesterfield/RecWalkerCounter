The files contained in this folder are the source files and
all of the documentation for the Rec Walker project. 

The objective is to track one way traffic through the 
south Entrance of the student Recreation center.

To do this, we used an Arduino with ultrasonic sensors
attached to a Raspberry Pi. The Pi runs python code 
which sends data to a database. From there, we use a PHP
API to extract data from the database and display it 
on a website
